### ü§¨Gripes
***
**Gripes About `TikTok` Live Streaming Platform:**

1. In order to go live from a computer, you are required to have a minimum of `1,000 followers`. If you choose not to go live from a computer, you won't be able to utilize OBS for streaming, and the method of capturing TikTok's streaming code through packet capture is no longer effective.
2. Unfortunately, you cannot mute the microphone while streaming from a mobile device.
3. I have made several attempts at live-streaming. My initial plan was to showcase my personal PC's screen (which was running the project) by using a remote tool. However, TikTok unjustly and inexplicably banned my live stream on two separate occasions.

So, that's why there are no `TikTok(Douyin)` screenshots in this project.  
**Fuck the TikTok(Douyin)!**

### TODO

- [ ] Gift-triggered AI Q&A (Only users who have sent gifts are allowed to AI Q&A by sending barrage, such as starting an AI Q&A session with a rose gift.)
- [ ] Virtual AI Characters (A virtual character displayed alongside and capable of providing voice-read responses.)
