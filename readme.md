### 🤬Gripes
***
**Gripes About `TikTok` Live Streaming Platform:**

> 1. In order to go live from a computer, you are required to have a minimum of `1,000 followers`. If you choose not to go live from a computer, you won't be able to utilize OBS for streaming, and the method of capturing TikTok's streaming code through packet capture is no longer effective.
> 2. Unfortunately, you cannot mute the microphone while streaming from a mobile device.
> 3. I have made several attempts at live streaming. My initial plan was to showcase my personal PC's screen (which was running the project) by using a remote tool. However, TikTok unjustly and inexplicably banned my live stream on two separate occasions.

**So! Fuck the Tiktok(Douyin)!**
